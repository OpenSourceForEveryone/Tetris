# Taking it Further

Want to extend the Tetris Tournament app? Here are some ideas:

## Extend the user experience

Customize Tetris Tournament app to give custom user experience by updating or
adding new component in Creation/Participation/Leaderboard view. All components
are under `src/components`. The root component of Creation, Participation and
Leaderboard View is `src/CreateView.js`, `src/UpdateView.js` and `src/DetailView.js`
respectively.

###Personalize the app

* Personalize the app by updating the app icon `assets/images/appIcon.png` and
    `assets/images/outline.png`

* Personalize the app by changing the app strings under `assets/strings`.

* Personalize the app by changing the app theme. The app uses [FluentUI Northstar Library](https://fluentsite.z22.web.core.windows.net) for UI and theming can be customized by updating code
    using the FluentUI documentation
